Data2 Set 		03.July.2018 / mac

The placement of the part RPI2 was wrong in the old version of the data (Duckiebot Hut v1.1 2018D.zip). 
The part has to be placed on the bottom side instead of the top side. This data set (Duckiebot Hut v1.1 2018D data2.zip) has been modified as follows:

-The assembly info pdf has been modified to clarify parts placements.
-The Pick and Place file has been modified. Part RPI2 is now to be mounted on bottom side.
