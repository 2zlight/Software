name: Lane control

desc: >

    The ability to control the robot to stay in a lane with a certain d_ref.

    The steady-state error is less than max_d_err.

    The performance is such that it is possible for the robot to move
    from d0 to d0 + delta d in a time that is

        delta t <= alpha + beta * delta d

    The robot can travel at least at v_min velocity

quantification:

    max_d_err:
        unit: m
        desc: Maximum deviation from d_ref.

    alpha:
        unit: s
        desc: Allowed delay

    beta:
        unit: s/m
        desc: time allowed for each unit of displacement

    v_min:
        unit: m/s
        desc: Velocity of the robot
