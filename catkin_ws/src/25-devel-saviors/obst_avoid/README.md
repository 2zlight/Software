# Package `pkg_name` {#pkg_name}
This is the first part of our devel saviors package and can be used as follows:

the scripts folder provides three useful files:
1. duckiedetect_final is a jupyter notebook file to tryout new duckiedetection algorithms and is for trying new algorithms
2. the dt-bag-thumbnails script provides the functionality to extract jpg pictures from rosbags
3. the eval_detection offers a script for evaluating the current implementation

the node implements a first rough duckiedetection algorithm which has to be further improved
the node can be launched via:
roslaunch obst_avoid obst_avoid.launch
BUT: we need an additional library istall via: "pip install scikit-image"
