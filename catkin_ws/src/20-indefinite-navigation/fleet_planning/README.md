# Using the Virtual Duckiebot Node

This package includes a virtual duckiebot node to enable testing of the taxi central without actual duckiebots.
After starting a roscore, start the virtual duckiebot node located in `fleet_planning/include/fleet_planning/virtual_duckiebot_node.py`.
This node provides one service called 'send_location_information'. By calling this service with the two arguments ("duckie_name" and "location")
a message will be posted to the /taxi/location topic as if an actual duckiebot published its location.
Furthermore it parses all messages that it receives on the /taxi/commands topic and prints them to the console.
