# Package `calibration` {#calibration}

<move-here src='#pkg_name-autogenerated'/>


This package is an automatic wheels calibration procedure. 

- The launchfile commands.launch sends specific voltage command to the weehls while recording images with the camera in a Rosbag. 

- The launchfile calibration.launch calculates the differents parameters of the theoretical model that fit best the trajectory of the Duckiebot.

- The launchfile test.launch tests if the callibration has succeded or not.

## Commands

To calibrate the wheeels, place your Duckiebot with its USB mounted in front of the same chessboard as for the camera calibration at a distance of slightly more than 1 meters (~ 2 duckie tiles) and run the following command : 

	duckiebot $ roslaunch calibration commands.launch veh:=robot name 

The program will publish at a frequency of 30 Hz in the topic robot_name/wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd the following commands : 

- A ramp (the same increasing voltage command to the right and left wheels) 
- No command for 10 seconds (so you can replace your Duckiebot at 1 meters of the Chessboard)
- A sinusoid (a cosinus voltage command in opposite phase between the left and the right wheel)

When the programm will exit, you will have a Rosbag named robot_name_calibration.bag in your USB drive containing the commands published and the images. 


If the chessboard goes out of the field of view of the Duckiebot too quickly, you can tune the voltage commands by typing the values of the parameters :

	duckiebot $ roslaunch calibration commands.launch veh:=robot name vFin:=![value] Nstep:=![value] k1:=![value] k2:=![value] omega:=![value] duration:=![value]

where :
- vFin is the final voltage of the ramp command (0.5 by default)
- Nstep is the number of step used to go from 0 to vFin for the ramp (180 steps by default)

- k1, k2 and omega are the parameters of the sinusoid command $k1 + k2 \cdot \cos(omega \cdot t)$ (by default, k1=0.2, k2=0.06, omega=0.007)
- duration is the duration of the sinusoid command (by default 2000)


## Calibration

Once you have recorded a Rosbag, you can run the following commands : 

	laptop $ roslaunch calibration calibration.launch veh:=robot name  path:=/absolute/path/to/the/rosbag/folder/
    
(path example: path:=/home/user_name/sysid/) Do not forget the backslash at the end of the path. (Common mistake: path not starting from /home, forgetting the last / in the path)

It will calculate the parameters of the theoretical model that fit best the trajectory your Duckiebot made. This values will be stored in the file 

	![DUCKIEFLEET_ROOT]/calibrations/kinematics/![robot name].yaml


## Test 

To check if your calibration is right, you can run the following test : 

	duckiebot $ roslaunch calibration test.launch

Your Duckiebot should first drive straight for 1m (in 5s) then turn a full circle to the left (in 8s) and then a full circle to the right (in 8s).
